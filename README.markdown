Twitter RemoteObjects
=====================
A simple wrapper around the Twitter API using [SixApart's][1] [RemoteObjects][2]
library.  It's goal is to be small and mimic the actual Twitter API, rather
than try to recreate it.

Project State: ALPHA
--------------------
This project is extreme, early alpha at this point.  I'm still fleshing out how I want this
to look.  Basics are in place, but the only docs are the code and tests (few as they may be).
This is a itch project, so it may not become full featured.

You've been warned.
